 <p>Because it turns out that I am <em> really </em> bad at learning things too complicated to learn the way an bulimia patient eats their binges (I heard that you're allowed to make jokes on these types of things as long as you're affected yourself you know...like fat people were allowed to make jokes about fat people...?)
